### Group4Submission
This was the semester long project for Topics in Computer Science
The goal was to model the movements of a small robot. 
Significantly more indepth details are in the report
The files that I created alone where

### SE433 Software Testing and Quality Assurance
This was my first grad level course.
Two different assignments exist in here both focusing on writing unit tests in JUnit
Skeleton files were provided only for the main classes (DateObj, ShoppingCart, Product) but the functionality was our portion as well as creating the tests from scratch
